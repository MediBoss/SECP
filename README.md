### App Design

### Objective

The main objective of the application is to inform and help user narrow their computer science concentration to one by providing valuable and important informations about each CS field. 

### Audience
- Primary : High School Juniors & Seniors who are interested in CS -
- Secondary : College students who are in the blur of CS.
- Tertiary : Anyone who is interested in Computer Science.


### User Experience

#### Action 1 -  User On-boarding 

When the user boots up the app, there will be a quick on-boarding composed of 4 swappable screens showing  and explaining the main features of the application.

#### Action 2 - Home Page

After the on-boarding screens, the user will be on the home page. There will be two main clickable Cells - Software Dev Paths and Soft Skills.

#### Action 3 - Software Dev Paths

When the user clicks on this, he/she will be see a scrollable collection view of possible paths a computer science major could concentrate in. On each cell, there will be an image, the name of the path, the annual salary, Education level required, and projection rate. E.g : Data Scientist, $120K/year, 75%.
    
        - Sub Action : Click on a cell
 
        When the user clicks on specific cell, he/she will get more information 
        about that path.


#### Action 4 - Soft Skills

When the user clicks on this, he/she will be see a scrollable collection view of possible soft skills and tools a computer science major could hone in that goes along with some paths. On each cell, there will be an image, the name of the skill and its type. E.g : Git , collaboration.

        - Sub Action : Click on a cell
 
        When the user clicks on specific cell, he/she will get more information 
        about that skill.

### MVP Milestones
[The overall milestones of first usable build, core features, and polish are just suggestions, plan to finish earlier if possible. The last 20% of work tends to take about as much time as the first 80% so do not slack off on your milestones!]
